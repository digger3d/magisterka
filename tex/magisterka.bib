abstract = {The introduction of high-resolution time lapse imaging and molecular biological tools has changed dramatically the rate of progress towards the understanding of the complex structure-function relations in synapses of central spiny neurons. Standing issues, including the sequence of molecular and structural processes leading to formation, morphological change, and longevity of dendritic spines, as well as the functions of dendritic spines in neurological/psychiatric diseases are being addressed in a growing number of recent studies. There are still unsettled issues with respect to spine formation and plasticity: Are spines formed first, followed by synapse formation, or are synapses formed first, followed by emergence of a spine? What are the immediate and long-lasting changes in spine properties following exposure to plasticity-producing stimulation? Is spine volume/shape indicative of its function? These and other issues are addressed in this review, which highlights the complexity of molecular pathways involved in regulation of spine structure and function, and which contributes to the understanding of central synaptic interactions in health and disease.},

@article{Costa2007,
abstract = {The size and complexity of data sets is ever increasing. Clustering, considered the most important unsupervised learning problem, is used to reveal structures and to identify "natural" groupings on the multivariate data. Several competitive learning algorithms were developed for this application. The Growing Neural Gas (GNG) is an incremental algorithm, where no previous information about the number of clusters is preset. New units are added according to the training dynamics. GNG produces a graph that represents the topology of trained data. Each vertex corresponds to a neuron in which input data have been mapped. This paper describes a simple algorithm to better produce the partitioning of this graph, generating connected components that represent different data clusters. The algorithm automatically finds the number of classes and the associated neurons.},

@article{Zhu2002,
abstract = {We investigate the use of unlabeled data to help labeled data in classification. We propose a simple iterative algorithm, label propagation, to propagate labels through the dataset along high density areas defined by unlabeled data. We analyze the algorithm, show its solution, and its connection to several other algorithms. We also show how to learn parameters by minimum spanning tree heuristic and entropy minimization, and the algorithms ability to perform feature selection. Experiment results are promising.},
